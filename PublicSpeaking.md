## Writing Tips

  * What emotions do you want the audience to feel?
  * Why should this specific audience care?
  * What is the main message, in one sentence.  Repeat the main message throughout the talk.
  * Don't summarise, advertise.
  * Add a bold statement, analogy or preferably a personalized story. 
  * Trim: If it doesn't add, it detracts
  * Don't keep the main idea a surprise, say at the start why people should care.
  
## Preparation Tips
  
  * Learn your material, so you don't need any notes.
  * Rehearse in front of a practice audience, even if it is just one person.
  * Practice not saying "uhm", by also stopping to say it in your every day speach or have someone count the number of times you say it, when you practice.
  * Nerves: If you are still nervous, practice breathing with your stomach.
  * Posture: By default, elbows bent around 90 degrees.  Use your hands to gesture.
  
## Presenting tips

  * Don't say sorry or let people know you this is your first time or that you didn't prepare.
  * Call attention to the obvious. Acknowledge the likely feelings of the audience to defuse a situation.
  * Presenting is a gift. Don't thank people for coming, they should be thanking you.
