    + Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness, Fairness
    > "Status is about relative importance to others. Certainty concerns being able to predict the future. Autonomy provides a sense of control over events. Relatedness is a sense of safety with others, of friend rather than foe. And fairness is a perception of fair exchanges between people. These five domains activate either the ‘primary reward’ or ‘primary threat’ circuitry (and associated networks) of the brain. For example, a perceived threat to one’s status activates similar brain networks to a threat to one’s life. in the same way, a perceived increase in fairness activates the same reward circuitry as receiving a monetary reward."

## Company Culture

    > "Many new leaders may negatively impact the domains of SCARF by accident. They may know how things should be done, and subsequently provide too much direction and not enough positive feedback, thereby affecting people’s status. They often don’t provide clear expectations, impacting certainty. They micro manage, impacting autonomy. They want to maintain a professional distance, impacting relatedness. And, they may impact fairness by not being transparent enough. When the opposite happens and you meet someone who makes you feel better about yourself, provides clear expectations, lets you make decisions, trusts you and is fair, you will probably work harder for them as you feel intrinsically rewarded by the relationship itself."
 
    > "Techniques for motivating and rewarding staff are largely based on the carrot and stick principle, with the carrot mostly involving money or a promotion. The SCARF model points to more creative ways of motivating that may not just be cheaper, but also stronger and more sustainable."

    > "in most people, the question ‘can i offer you some feedback’ generates a similar response to hearing fast footsteps behind you at night. Performance reviews often generate status threats, explaining why they are often ineffective at stimulating behavioral change. if leaders want to change others’ behavior, more attention must be paid to reducing status threats when giving feedback. one way to do this is by allowing people to give themselves feedback on their own performance."

    + The best managers in the world create moments where genuine dialogue can occur, where employees feel their opinions matter and like they are cared about in a unique way.

    + Performance reviews are artifacts left over from the Industrial Revolution.
    + Performance reviews are not effective at improving performance. They have never shown their value as leadership tools -- but they make excellent power-and-control mechanisms, and that is one reason some companies have trouble giving up on them.
    + If the relationship is healthy between the manager and the employee, they're having regular conversations anyway.
    + Of course, employees need to be able to get feedback when they need it. If they can get that feedback without being graded like elementary school students then it's a win-win for everybody.
    + It doesn't help an employee move forward for a manager to tell them what they did well and did badly last year. If a manager needs to give someone feedback, they should do that in the moment — not months later.

    > "They’re really toxic and people hate them. You’re creating artificial steps just to check a box."

    > "Brain imaging research positing that even high-performing employees automatically go into a defence mode during performance reviews, turning a supposedly productive meeting into a fight-or-flight scenario."

    > "Dell, Microsoft, IBM and other big business names ... have ditched the process"
    > "Companies that say they are getting rid of ratings are still using ratings. They just have different labels. For one thing, managers must have some rationale for assigning promotions and raises."
    > "If there’s no data on performance, the process of handing out promotions and raises can turn chaotic. In some cases, companies could be vulnerable to lawsuits if they don’t have a way to justify decisions."
    
    > "restricts creativity, generates mountains of paperwork, and serves no real purpose."
    > "appraisals haven’t prevented discriminatory practices."
    > "there’s the possibility of bias in every piece of qualitative information that decision makers consider"

    > "performance actually declined when people were rated relative to others.  Nor did the ratings seem accurate."

    > In many organisations, line managers assign provisional grades then thrash out the overall distribution in “moderation” meetings with other managers. But it is hard to objectively rank people in white-collar jobs doing different things. “You’d have people sat in a room who barely knew each other, comparing apples with pears,” said a second manager at a different firm.

    > these systems are often corrosive for morale, which damages the very performance levels they aim to improve. Research shows that feedback has a moderately positive effect on performance on average, but in a third of cases it decreases performance. What is key is whether people feel the feedback is fair.

    > Microsoft scrapped forced distribution in 2013. The UK’s senior civil service followed suit in 2019.

    > Human resources departments have had to rethink plenty of old notions since the pandemic hit. The counterproductive pseudoscience of forced distribution ought to be one idea that finally stays dead.
